Attended the University of Washington where he was active in the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), the conscientious objector movement, and became a Quaker. At the outbreak of World War II, he was one of only a handful of individuals to challenge the curfew and removal orders being enforced against Japanese on the West Coast, citing \"Christian principles,\" and asserting \"a duty to maintain the democratic standards for which this nation lives.\" He turned himself in to the FBI, was found guilty, and served time for violating the curfew order, and failing to report for \"evacuation.\" While serving time for this conviction, Gordon was served with a draft notice and again, refused to comply. He subsequently served another period of time as a draft resister. In 1943 the Supreme Court upheld his convictions. Some forty years postwar, in 1986, his case was reopened and his convictions surrounding the incarceration were vacated by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing in part that, \"racial bias was the cornerstone of the internment orders.\" Gordon Hirabayashi passed away in January of 2012.",

Attended the University of San Francisco School of Law where she honed her commitment to political and social activism. Only a few years out of law school, she joined a team of lawyers working to reopen the Supreme Court's 1944 decision in <i>Korematsu v. United States</i>. Convicted of violating the exclusion order during World War II, Mr. Korematsu's case went all the way to the Supreme Court where the exclusion and incarceration of Japanese Americans was upheld as constitutional, based on the government's argument of \"military necessity.\" Through a petition for writ of error <i>coram nobis</i> (establishing that the case was premised on errors of fact withheld from the judge and the defense by the prosecution), the legal team reopened the case, provided evidence that the factual underpinnings to the exclusion orders were fraudulent, and successfully had the <i>Korematsu</i> conviction vacated, as well as a handful of other similar convictions.

Began working for the <i>Baltimore News Post</i> in 1937 until the draft of 1940 when he was called to serve one year in the U.S. armed forces. Joined the army at the age of twenty-one, well aware of Hitler's aggression in Europe and fairly certain the U.S. would have to join the war effort to stop him.

Mr. Frisino shares his memories of the day Pearl Harbor was bombed and his own personal reaction to the bombing. Went through training as a radio operator, met and married his wife, Harriette, and went through rigorous Officer Candidate School before being shipped overseas to fight for 2 years in the jungles of Burma as a communications supply officer. In 1945, returned home to his wife in Seattle, Washington and began his career at the <i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i> where he worked for over 50 years.

Strongly influenced by parents' values regarding racial tolerance and inclusion, and principles learned through Unitarian Church. While attending Antioch College in Ohio, became involved in political and social activism for civil rights. Joined the youth branch of NAACP, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), and other groups. Active in sit-ins and other demonstrations addressing racial inequality, peace and related issues, eventually becoming a full-time organizer. Worked for the United Autoworkers Union. Resisted the draft, and was indicted by a federal grand jury in 1964. Convicted of failing to report for military service and sentenced to three years in prison. Graduated from Antioch College, 1966. Appealed his conviction to the United States Court of Appeals and lost. Served his sentence in federal institutions in Milan, Michigan, Terre Haute, Indiana, and Danbury, Connecticut. Following release from prison in 1969, attended graduate school at Boston University, obtaining PhD in political science in 1973. Accepted to Harvard Law School. While a law student, researched and filed a writ of <i>error coram nobis</i> with the federal court in which he had been convicted, and as a result had his conviction vacated. (Writ of error <i>coram nobis</i> establishes that the original case was premised on errors of fact withheld from the judge and the defense by the prosecution.) Graduated from Harvard Law School in 1978. Taught undergraduate and law school courses at several schools before joining faculty of the University of California at San Diego. While conducting research at the National Archives and Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. in preparation for writing a book, discovered evidence of governmental misconduct during World War II, which refuted the U.S. government's rationale of \"military necessity\" for the mass incarceration of persons of Japanese ancestry in 1942. Using this evidence, assisted the congressional Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians. Contacted original defendants, initiated formation of legal teams, and was instrumental in filing petitions using the writ of error <i>coram nobis</i>, resulting in the reconsideration of the wartime \"internment cases\": <i>Hirabayashi</i>, <i>Korematsu</i>, and <i>Yasui</i>.

            "att10bio": "Nisei male. Born in Seattle in 1915 and attended Washington grade school, Garfield High School and the University of Washington. He grew up as a typical Nisei, working summers in Alaska salmon canneries and Western Avenue produce brokerages to pay for his education.\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\nHe became interested in writing at Garfield where he was sports editor of the school paper. While attending the University he worked at the weekly <i>Japanese American Courier</i> published by the late Jimmie Sakamoto.\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\nA faculty adviser at the University urged Hosokawa to drop out of the journalism school \"because no newspaper in the country would hire a Japanese boy.\" Hosokawa rejected the advice, but when he graduated in 1937 he found the professor was right. After working as a male secretary writing letters, Hosokawa and his bride, the former Alice Miyake of Portland, Oregon, went to Singapore in 1938 to help launch an English language daily. A year and a half later Hosokawa moved to Shanghai to work on an American-owned monthly magazine, the <i>Far Eastern Review</i>. Then, sensing the inevitability of war, he returned to Seattle in 1941 just five weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor.\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\nWhen war came, Hosokawa served as executive director of Seattle JACL's Emergency Defense Council helping people in the community to cope. He and his family were removed to the Puyallup Assembly Center, Washington. When other Seattleites were moved to Minidoka concentration camp, Idaho, Hosokawa and his wife and infant son were sent to Heart Mountain, Wyoming. Later, he learned he had been separated from his Seattle friends because he was considered a potential troublemaker.\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\nHe was in Heart Mountain for 14 months, working as editor of the camp newspaper, the <i>Heart Mountain Sentinel</i>, before being released to join the Des Moines, Iowa <i>Register</i> in 1943. In 1946 he moved to Denver to work on the <i>Denver Post</i>.\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\nIn 38 years at <i>The Post</i> he held such assignments as executive news editor, assistant managing editor and Sunday editor. He covered the Japanese peace treaty in San Francisco in 1951, the Summit meeting in Paris in 1960 and the Zengakuren student riots in Japan that same year. He also had assignments as war correspondent in Korea and Vietnam, and for 17 years was editor of <i>Empire</i>, the <i>Post's</i> prize-winning Sunday magazine. For his last seven years at the Post Hosokawa was editor of the editorial page -- a Japanese American imprisoned during World War II as a potential security risk who now directed the opinion section of a major American newspaper.\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\nAfter retiring from the <i>Post</i> in 1984 he served the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i> as ombudsman columnist for seven years. Hosokawa has taught journalism classes at the University of Colorado, University of Northern Colorado and University of Wyoming. He wrote a weekly comment column called \"From the Frying Pan\" in JACL's weekly Pacific Citizen from 1942 until 1999.\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\nAmong other honors, Hosokawa is a former president of the American Association of Sunday and Feature Editors and a member of that organization's Hall of Fame, a charter member of the Denver Press Club Hall of Fame. He was named JACL's Nisei of the Biennium in 1958, and has published 12 books. Hosokawa and his wife Alice, who died in 1998, had four children.",

He was arrested in May of 1942, taken to jail, and eventually transferred to the Tanforan Assembly Center, California, where his family was being held. He legally challenged the constitutionality of Executive Order 9066, and his case made it to the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld the order in 1944. Following World War II, Mr. Korematsu moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he married and raised a family before returning to California. In the early 1980s, his case was reopened after the discovery of a crucial document indicating that in the original 1944 case, the federal government had lied to the high court. The conviction was vacated by U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel in 1983, and in 1998, Mr. Korematsu was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Mr. Korematsu passed away in 2005.",

Received his officer's commission, and served in Korea in 2004 and 2005. While stationed in Fort Lewis, Washington, in 2006, asked for permission to resign his commission based on his understanding that the war in Iraq was illegal, and refused to deploy to Iraq with his unit. Was court-martialed by the Army, and his first court-martial trial in February 2007 ended in a mistrial. A second trial was scheduled but stayed in October 2007. A judge ruled in 2008 that Watada could not be retried on three of the five counts against him. The Army appealed, but the case was dismissed on May 6, 2009.",

Yasui's fine was removed and he was released to the Minidoka concentration camp, Idaho. In the 1980s, his case was reopened under writ of error <i>coram nobis</i>, and 1986 his conviction was overturned by the Oregon federal court. Minoru Yasui passed away on November 12, 1986.",
